## Rules and Guidlines

- We will be looking at the readability and cleanliness of your code
- Provide unit tests. The cleanliness and readbility of tests is just as
important as your production code.
- Please provide 80% test coverage for your code.
- Think simple. Readability and modularity are better than being clever
- Make a github repository and commit your work in small cohesive chunks.

## Step 1 - Build a system to parse and sort a set of records

Create a command line app that takes as input a file with a set of records in
one of three formats described below, and outputs (to the screen) the set of
records sorted in one of three ways.

### Input

A record consists of the following 5 fields: last name, first name, gender,
date of birth, and favorite color. The input is 3 files, each containing records
stored in a different format. You may generate these files yourself, and you can
make certain assumptions if it makes solving your problem easier.

- The pipe-delimited file lists each record as follows:

        LastName | FirstName | Gender | FavoriteColor | DateOfBirth

- The comma-delimited file looks like this:

        LastName, FirstName, Gender, FavoriteColor, DateOfBirth

- The space-delimited file looks like this:

        LastName FirstName Gender FavoriteColor DateOfBirth

### Output

Create and display 3 different views of the data you read in:

- Output 1 - sorted by gender (females before males) then by last name ascending
- Output 2 - sorted by birth date, ascending
- Output 3 - sorted by last name, descending

Display dates in the format M/D/YYYY

### Completed

To check output for step 1, execute the command `lein run`

## Step 2 - Build a REST API to access your system

Tests for this section are required as well.

**Within the same code base**, build a standalone REST API with the following
endpoints:

- POST /records - Post a single data line in any of the 3 formats supported by
your existing code
- GET /records/gender - return records sorted by gender
- GET /records/birthdate - returns records sorted by birthdate
- GET /records/name - returns records sorted by name

It's your choice how you render the output from these endpoints as long as it is
well structured data. These endpoints should return JSON.

To keep it simple, don't worry about using a persistent datastore.

## Step 3 - Review and Refactor

When you are invited to interview in person, we will sit down with you and offer
feedback and guidance in refactoring your code. We would like to see you pick up
these skills quickly and apply them during the interview to improve the
structure of your solution.

Please check-in your project files or bring your own laptop for this part.


## Assumptions I'm Making

- "input" files can have data stored in format of my choice, e.g. date can be
stored as ISO8601 so long as the display adheres to the homework spec
- favorite color and date of birth will be provided in a format that does not
conflict with any chosen delimiting character
- which input format is known beforehand, don't have to determine dynamically
- responses won't be so large that a conversion step before response matters
- responses do not have to be paginated for size considerations
